## Introduction
This full-stack CRUD application was built to gain expertise using the MEN Stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js) to create useful apps. The project was inspired by providing a private area for students, professionals, and creatives to document their work in a structured and visually appealing way.

## App Brief
The application allows users to securely log in and manage a personal gallery of their academic, professional, and personal projects. Each user can create, update, and delete projects, complete with categories, descriptions.
